    "You will form groups of four and work on this exercise together, submitting a single code at the end of the class period. You will work together on exercises in the same groups each Thursday this quarter. Introduce yourselves and and decide among yourselves which roles you would like to undertake. Note that you cannot have the same role two weeks in a row, and you must fill each role at least once during the quarter.\n",

    "\n",
    "3) Researcher: Search slides, notes, and internet for solutions to coding problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Documenter: Make sure code is adequately commented. Make sure any code solutions used from an online source like Stack Overflow are clearly noted and cited to avoid plagiarism.\n",
